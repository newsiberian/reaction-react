# reaction-react
Reaction React components

## How to run this:
* there is no way now to create users, so we need to use an existing Reaction build. You need to remember admin `email/password`. Then you could simply overwrite `meteor/local` folder by Reaction copy.
* then you will need to put `reaction-core` package to the `packages` folder. I'm using modified version from [this branch](https://github.com/newsiberian/reaction-core/tree/uni_compat).
* `meteor update && meteor` then try: `http://localhost:3000/shop`
